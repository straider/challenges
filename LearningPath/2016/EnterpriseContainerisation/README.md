:: Containers and Microservices ::
==================================

# Concepts

- What is a Software Container?
- What are the differences between Virtual Machines and Software Containers?

# Technologies

## Operating Systems

- [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) is an open-source lightweight operating system based on the Linux kernel and designed for providing infrastructure to clustered deployments, while focusing on automation, ease of application deployment, security, reliability and scalability. As an operating system, CoreOS provides only the minimal functionality required for deploying applications inside software containers, together with built-in mechanisms for service discovery and configuration sharing;
- [Atomic](https://www.projectatomic.io/) is a lightweight, immutable platform, designed with the sole purpose of running containerized applications, based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or the CentOS and Fedora projects;
- [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/) is a lightweight Linux distribution based on Tiny Core Linux made specifically to run Docker containers. It runs completely from RAM, weights ~27MB and boots in ~5s.

## Virtualization

- VMWare
- VirtualBox
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

## Containerization

- [Docker](Docker.md)
- [Kubernetes](Kubernetes.md)
- [Mesos](Mesos.md)
- [OpenShift](OpenShift.md)
- [Fabric8](Fabric8.md)
