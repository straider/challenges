:: Enterprise Integration Patterns ::
=====================================

# Overview

> [Enterprise Application Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_application_integration) (EAI) is the use of software and computer systems' architectural principles to integrate a set of enterprise computer applications. Enterprise application integration is an integration framework composed of a collection of technologies and services which form a middleware or "middleware framework" to enable integration of systems and applications across an enterprise.

> It can be used for different purposes:
- **Data integration**: Ensures that information in multiple systems is kept consistent. This is also known as enterprise information integration (EII);
- **Vendor independence**: Extracts business policies or rules from applications and implements them in the EAI system, so that even if one of the business applications is replaced with a different vendor's application, the business rules do not have to be re-implemented;
- **Common facade**: An EAI system can front-end a cluster of applications, providing a single consistent access interface to these applications and shielding users from having to learn to use different software packages.

> EAI can also increase coupling between systems and therefore increase management overhead and costs. However, EAI is not just about sharing data between applications; it focuses on sharing both business data and business process.
