:: Spring Cloud Contract ::
===========================

# Overview

> Spring Cloud Contract is an umbrella project holding solutions that help users in successfully implementing the [Consumer Driven Contracts](http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html) approach.

> Currently Spring Cloud Contract consists of the Spring Cloud Contract Verifier project. Spring Cloud Contract Verifier is a tool that enables Consumer Driven Contract (CDC) development of JVM-based applications. It is shipped with Contract Definition Language (DSL). Contract definitions are used to produce following resources:
- JSON stub definitions to be used by [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/) (HTTP Server Stub) when doing integration testing on the client code (client tests). Test code must still be written by hand, test data is produced by Spring Cloud Contract Verifier;
- Messaging routes if you’re using one. We’re integrating with Spring Integration, Spring Cloud Stream and Apache Camel. You can however set your own integrations if you want to;
- Acceptance tests (in JUnit or Spock) used to verify if server-side implementation of the API is compliant with the contract (server tests). Full test is generated by Spring Cloud Contract Verifier.

> Spring Cloud Contract Verifier moves TDD to the level of software architecture:
- ensure that HTTP / Messaging stubs (used when developing the client) are doing exactly what actual server-side implementation will do;
- promote acceptance test driven development method and Microservices architectural style;
- to provide a way to publish changes in contracts that are immediately visible on both sides of the communication;
- to generate boilerplate test code used on the server side.

## Challenges

> Social remark - both client and server development teams need to communicate directly and discuss changes while going through the process. CDC is all about communication.
