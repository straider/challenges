## What is Fuse ESB?

## What is JBoss Fuse?

> Red Hat [JBoss Fuse](http://developers.redhat.com/products/fuse/overview/) is an open source, lightweight and modular integration platform with a new-style Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) that supports integration beyond the data center.

## What is Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works?

> Red Hat [JBoss Fuse Service Works](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Fuse_Service_Works/6.0/html/Getting_Started_Guide/chap-Red_Hat_JBoss_Fuse_Service_Works.html#What_is_the_JBoss_Enterprise_SOA_Platform) is a platform for developing enterprise application integration (EAI) and service-oriented architecture (SOA) solutions. It consists of a service component framework, business rules/complex event processing, life-cycle governance, runtime governance and process automation. It is built on the same core as JBoss Fuse with enterprise messaging, Camel and CXF so, therefore, users can use it to design, deploy, integrate and orchestrate business services.

> With the release of version 6.2.1, [Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works and Red Hat JBoss Fuse are now merged](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1980803) into a single product, with the merged product now called Red Hat JBoss Fuse. The combined product gives you a choice between two container technologies: a J2EE container (Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform); and an OSGi container (Apache Karaf).
