:: Consumer-Driven Contracts :: Pact ::
=======================================

# Overview

## What is [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/)?

> The Pact family of frameworks provide support for Consumer Driven Contracts testing.

> A Contract is a collection of agreements between a client (Consumer) and an API (Provider) that describes the interactions that can take place between them.
> Consumer Driven Contracts is a pattern that drives the development of the Provider from its Consumers point of view.
> Pact is a testing tool that guarantees those Contracts are satisfied.

[Pact](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact) is used to define a pact between service consumers and providers, enabling "consumer driven contract" testing.

The [pact-foundation/pact-specification](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification) describes the pact format and verification specifications.

## Why use Pact?

There's also a ["convince me"](https://docs.pact.io/faq/convinceme.html) page.

### Pros

> https://docs.pact.io/
- **Confidence**: Continuously evolve your codebase knowing that Pact will guarantee Contracts are met.
- **Faster**: No need to setup end-to-end environments. No need for manual testing.
- **Less Error Prone**: Generation and verification of Contracts are automatically managed by Pact.

### Cons

## How to use Pact?

### Pact Server

### Pact Broker

### Consumer

### Producer
