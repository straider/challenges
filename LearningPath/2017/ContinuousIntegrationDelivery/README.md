:: Continuous Integration / Delivery ::
=======================================

# Overview

## Concepts

### Continuous Integration (CI)

[Continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
> In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
- Maintain a code repository;
- Automate the build;
- Make the build self-testing;
- Everyone commits to the baseline every day;
- Every commit (to baseline) should be built;
- Keep the build fast;
- Test in a clone of the production environment;
- Make it easy to get the latest deliverables;
- Everyone can see the results of the latest build;
- Automate deployment.

[Continuous Integration](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)
> Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

[Continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)
> Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software faster and more frequently.

> Continuous Delivery provides great benefits not only for the team developing the software, by increasing their confidence, but also for the product team, since the delivery of new features becomes a pure business decision:
- Builds Quality into the Product;
- Provide Quick and Effective Feedback;
- Requires Minimal Manual Interaction;
- Uses the Same Process and Binaries;
- Delivers (almost) Any Version Any Time.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
