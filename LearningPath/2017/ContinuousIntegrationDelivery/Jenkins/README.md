# Overview

## What is [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)?

[What is Jenkins?](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Meet+Jenkins)
> Jenkins is an award-winning, cross-platform, continuous integration and continuous delivery application that increases your productivity. Use Jenkins to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also allows you to continuously deliver your software by providing powerful ways to define your build pipelines and integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.

[Jenkins (software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software))
> Jenkins is an open source automation server written in Java. The project was forked from Hudson after a dispute with Oracle. Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the whole software development process, with now common things like continuous integration, but by further empowering teams to implement the technical part of a Continuous Delivery.

## Features

## History

- Jenkins was originally developed as the Hudson project. Hudson's creation started in summer of 2004 at Sun Microsystems. It was first released in java.net in Feb. 2005.
- Around 2007 Hudson became known as a better alternative to CruiseControl and other open-source build-servers.
- During November 2010, an issue arose in the Hudson community with respect to the infrastructure used, which grew to encompass questions over the stewardship and control by Oracle.
    - Oracle claimed the right to the name and applied for a trademark in December 2010.
    - As a result, on January 11, 2011, a call for votes was made to change the project name from "Hudson" to "Jenkins".
    - On February 1, 2011, Oracle said that they intended to continue development of Hudson, and considered Jenkins a fork rather than a rename.
- In 2011, creator Kohsuke Kawaguchi received a Google-O'Reilly Open Source Award for his work on the Hudson/Jenkins project.
- In 2014, Kawaguchi became the Chief Technology Officer for CloudBees.
- On April 20, 2016 version 2 was released with the Pipeline plugin enabled by default. The plugin allows for writing build instructions in Apache Groovy.
