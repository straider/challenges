# Overview

## Definition

[Microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) - a definition of this new architectural term
> In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.

[Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices):
> Microservices is a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services should be fine-grained and the protocols should be lightweight.

## Benefits

 - Improves modularity;
 - Makes the application easier to understand, develop and test;
 - Parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently;
 - Enable continuous delivery and deployment.
